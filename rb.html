    <p><strong>Rabindranath was born on <span style="font-size:15px;color:white;background-color:black">7 May 1861</span> Calcutta. His father Debendranath Tagore was a leading light in the Brahmo Samaj – a reforming Hindu organisation which sought to promote a monotheistic interpretation of the Upanishads and move away from the rigidity of Hindu Orthodoxy which they felt was holding back India. Debendranath Tagore also encouraged his family to learn English.

            Rabindranath began writing from an early age and impressed with his free-flowing style and spontaneous compositions. He mostly rejected formal schooling; he spent much time being taught at home. In <span style="font-size:15px;color:white;background-color:black">1878 </span>he travelled to England and sought to study law at University College, London, but he left before finishing the degree.

            After returning to India, in <span style="font-size:15px;color:white;background-color:black">1901</span>, Tagore moved to Shantiniketan to found an ashram which became his focal point for writing and his view on schooling. He chose the name for the ashram – Shantiniketan meaning ‘Abode of Peace.’</strong></p>

    <p><strong>His writings and achievements:He wrote lots of poems,literature,short stories in his lifetime.Tagore's reputation as a writer was established in the United States and in England after the publication of "Gitanjali: Song Offerings", in which Tagore tried to find inner calm and explored the themes of divine and human love. The poems were translated into English by Tagore himself. His cosmic visions owed much to the lyric tradition of Vaishnava Hinduism and its concepts about the relationship between man and God. The poems appeared in <span style="font-size:15px;color:white;background-color:black">1912 </span>with an introduction by the great William Butler Yates, who wrote "These lyrics - which are in the original, my Indians tell me, full of subtlety of rhythm, of untranslatable delicacies of colour, of metrical invention - display in their thought a world I have dreamed of all my life long." His poems were praised by Ezra Pound, and drew the attention of the Nobel prize commitee.In the year <span style="font-size:15px;color:white;background-color:black">1913</span>,Tagore got<abbr title="The Nobel Prize is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances."> Nobel Prize</abbr>for his outstanding creation 'Gitanjali'.He died in <span style="font-size:15px;color:white;background-color:black">1941</span>.</strong></p>
